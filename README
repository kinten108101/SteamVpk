NOTICE:
	Multi-vpk addons support were added as a response to merging, a legacy practice that is not as flexible.

	When to group vpks into one folder: when it's the same addon split into parts (campaigns, modular huds, ...) Also, they are often made by the same author.
	
	When NOT to group vpks into one folder:

	- When they are broadly, only thematically, related (eg all l4d2 survivor models, all default gun models) -> use separators

	- When vpks complement each other and has no independent use, but can still be swapped around if needed (eg mrv voice goes with spectre coach, unless there are other robotic survivor models). There's also the matter of the display of credits.

	There will be no system to validate whether you've followed these rules. Use responsibly for your own sake!
NOTICE:
	When to merge vpks into one:
	- When you absolutely cant bear the ingame addon browser displaying multiple small addons. Although it is possible to merge, it is not recommended. This tool already serves to replace the addon browser, so you should keep the addon browser intact. Besides, modular vpk files are easier to manage.
